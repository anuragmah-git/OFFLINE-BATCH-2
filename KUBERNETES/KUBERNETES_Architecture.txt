# What is Kubernetes?

--> Its an container orchestration tool

# Why we need Kubernetes?

- website become popular
- traffic increases 1000/Day
- multiple container 
- again traffic increase 5000/min

- limit of hardware, now if we need to create multiple machine?
- but how connectivity works?

- 2nd scenario, now traffic increase you need to increase container, suppose need 100 container
  containers--->no auto scaling--->manual time taking  
  
- 3rd scenario fail of container ---> manage manual difficult

---- for above problems we need this container orchestration tool.-------

# What is cluster

---> Collection of machines/server.

# What is Worker Node 

---> Machine on which we run the workerloads

# Master Node 

---> To Manage the worker node

#Components of Cluster/Worker node

1. Container run time --> Container Software --> At the end, application will run in container with the help of this.
2. Kubelet --> The kubelet is the primary "node agent" that runs on each node --> it manages the whole machine.
3. Kube-Proxy --> kube-proxy is a n/w proxy that runs on each node in your cluster, implementating the part of kubernetes service concepts.Kube-Proxy maintains n/w
				  rules on nodes --> ip tables rules.
				  
#Master Node Components

1. KUBE-API-SERVER --> Communication channel for whole cluster -- all components communicate through api server --> kubelet connect with kube-api-server.

2. ETCD --> Key value data store --> cluster data base --> whole information from 0 to end of cluster is save in etcd 

3. KUBE-SCHEDULAR --> find best fit node for pods

4. KUBE-CONTROLLER-MANAGER --> monitoring --> maintain desired state of cluster --> include pods and node 

5. Kubectl --> its kubernetes command for managing all things.
