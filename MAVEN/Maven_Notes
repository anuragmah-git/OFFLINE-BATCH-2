============
Phase-1
============

#1
	Java Build and Deployment End-To-End Workflow.

#2
Basics
	- Java program
	- manual compilation (javac filename)
	- manual Run (java class-name)

#3
What is Maven? Why we need a build tool?
	

#4
Installation
	- Download jdk and extract it to your favourite location.
	- Download Apache Maven and extract it to your favourite location.
	- Set-up below Environment variables for Maven and JDK in order to run Maven
	  and JDK commands from any directory in the system.
		1. JAVA_HOME
		2. M2_HOME
		3. PATH

Installing JDK and Maven:
=======================
  A. create $USER_HOME/.bashrc
  
  B. create below Environment variables
	export JAVA_HOME=/home/User/Directory/Directory/jdk1.8.0_191
	export M2_HOME=/home/User/Directory/Directory/apache-maven-3.6.0
	export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$M2_HOME/bin:$PATH



Load .bashrc using below command or open new ternimial
	$ source .bashrc
 
Verify Installation
	$ java -version
	$ mvn --version or mvn -v

============
Phase-2
============

#5 TEST YOUR KOWLEDGE
	- Build and Deployment E2E work-flow and basics
	- What is compilation & why we compile the source code
	- Packaging sequence for Java application
	- What is Build
	- What is Deployment
	- Environment
	- Dev, QA & DevOps teams Interaction and Collaboration.

#6
Maven's standard project layout
=================================
Project creation:
-----------------
java projects which are created by maven, ideally follows below project folder structure.
	
		flipkart
			|
			src		pom.xml
			|
	main--------- test
	|				|
   java		       java
	|				|
  (group .Id)	  (group.Id)
	|				|
App.java		AppTest.java


flipkart - is called "Project name" / "ArtifactID"
src 	 - Source folder which contains the 
				application source code
main	 - Contains application's main functional code
test	 - Contains application's unit testing code
pom.xml  - Maven's build file using which we can
				configure build steps such as 
				compilation, test runs, jar/war creation,
				deployments...etc.


#7
Creating a Java Project using Maven: (It is for standlone project)

$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.Flipkart -DartifactId=Flipkart -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DinteractiveMode=false
(Note :- For creating Maven project we need GAV parameter).


============
Phase-3
============

#8
Building the maven project:
-----------------------
Execute "mvn install":

	'mvn install' command executes below maven "build life cycle" phases automatically. 
	- validate
		validate project's structure
	- initialize
		prepares project with initial pre-
		requisites ex: setting properties, creating 
		necessary directory structure..etc.	 
	- compile
		compiles "main" java code.
	- test-compile
		compiles "test" java code
	- test
		Runs the test cases and generates test reports.
	- package
		creates jar/war.
	- install
		copy built artifacts i.e jar/war file into local repository $USER_HOME/.m2 
               	(for ex. cd /home/swapnil/.m2/repository/com/Flipkart/Flipkart/1.1-SNAPSHOT$ my war file in this repository do ls after this path we will see the war/jar file                			(amazon-1.1-SNAPSHOT.war))

 (Note :- 1). After mvn install target folder is created in project directory.
	  2). mvn install command is used for compiles the code. )


#9
Verify Built artifacts:
--------------------------
Go to "target" folder and observe below.
	
			target
			  |
		classes     test-classes	surefire-reports	jar/war file


	classes: directory contains compiled class files
				of main source code
	test-classes: directory contains compiled class
				files of test source code
				
	surefire-reports: contains test reports.

	flipkart-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war: war file of main code

#
Note: first time when we run 'mvn install' command, Maven downloads all missing dependencies into .m2  from maven's central repository.
So we need to have internet when we run 'mvn install' command first time.


#10
Artifact path in local repository .m2
# More about local repository
 $USER_HOME/.m2/repository/groupId/artifactId/version/jar_war_file_name  (FOR EX. cd /home/swapnil/.m2/repository/com/flipkart/flipkart/1.1-SNAPSHOT/flipkart-1.1-SNAPSHOT.war)

- Package naming convention:
	artifactId-version.war (FOR EX. flipkart-1.1-SNAPSHOT.war)


============
Phase-4
============

#11: Maven Automatic Dependency resolution feature
	
	- Direct dependency - 
	- Transitive dependency(hamcrest is dependency of junit and becomes transitive dependency for our code)



Maven way of dependency addition, detection from different repositories.

#12
Maven repositories
	- Central
	- Private/Remote (Nexus/atifactrory)
	- Local (.m2)

#13
"mvn clean"  - remove old target folder from project directory.
	


============
Phase-5
============


#14
Build types
	- Complete build/Clean build/Full build
	- Incremental build
	- Nightly build
	- Daily build
	- bugfix build
	- adhoc/unplanned/emergency builds

#15
Skipping test cases:
	$ mvn install -DskipTests (skip test executon)
	$ mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true (skip test code compilation and execution)

#16
Run only unit testing i.e 'test' life cycle phase
	$ mvn surefire:test


#17
Where Maven's coordinates/GAV parameters come into picture / helpful?
	- Decide artifact storage path in local/central/remote
		repositories
	- Decide jar/war names.
	- Define a particular version of the jar file to be
		downloaded during dependency resolution.


============
Phase-6
============

--> web app builds
For WebApps, to generate the war file, use: -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp, option as part of 'mvn archetype:generate' command which you have used before for stand-alone application.


PROJECT-01 --> CREATE MAVEN web application for flipkart and perform end-to-end build and deployment.
===========    =======================================================================================

#
create one folder where we want to store our project
$ mkdir sourceCode

#
go to that created folder i.e. sourceCode 
$ cd sourceCode/

# 
After Create Maven web application project in our created directory usign below command.
$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.Netflix -DartifactId=Netflix -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DinteractiveMode=false -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp
      
	=> archetype:generate - this is generating maven project.
        => DgroupId - this is package name. 
	=> DartifactId - this is project name. 
	=> Dversion - this is version. 
	=> DinteractiveMode - keep always interactivemode is on false.
 (Note :- Here project name is Netflix)

#
After go to the project directory
$ cd projectName/

#
After entering project directory Build the application using below Maven command
$ mvn install

#
After mvn install target folder is creating in project folder in this folder Check final artifact i.e Netflix.war file in target directory 
 (For ex. (pom.xml  src  target) like this)
$ ls target 

#
Then Prepare tomcat for deployments / installation
- Download tomcat tar.gz file from apache.org site THEN 
- Extract it. THEN 
- Make sure JAVA_HOME and M2_HOME environment variable is set in .bashrc file.

#
Then copy flipkart.war file from target folder to tomcat webapps folder means, (Deploy Netflix.war into tomcat).
$ cp flipkart.war $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps

#
Start tomcat server
$ $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/./startup.sh

#
Launch application with below URL.
http://localhost or system IP:8080/Netflix
[http://tomcat_server_name:8080/warfilename]

#
find IP using below command
$ hostname -i

#26
- Building the War.
- Deployment into tomcat Server.
