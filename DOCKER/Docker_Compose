# What is Docker compose

	Docker compose
	--------------
		- tool for defining & running multi-container docker applications
		- use yaml files to configure application services (docker-compose.yml)
		- can start all services with a single command : docker compose up
		- can stop all services with a single command : docker compose down
		- can scale up selected services when required : --scale <service-name>=4

# Installation Steps
====================

Step.1) Check it is already installed or not using below command.
 
	- $ docker-compose -v

Step.2) Three ways to install docker-compose
  
  	1.) https://github.com/docker/compose/rel...

   	2.) Using PIP
    		pip install -U docker-compose
	
	3.) sudo apt-get install docker-compose

Step.2) Create docker compose file at any location on your system
	
	- $ touch docker-compose.yml

Step.3) Write a databse services in the yml file,  see below ex.

	- vim docker-compose.yml
		
		services:

		  web:
		    image: nginx

		  database:
		    image: redis

Step.4) Check the validity of file by command
	
	- $ docker-compose config

      => If you got Invalid Error then add version in the file, see below ex.

		version: '2'

		services:

		  web:
		    image: nginx

		  database:
		    image: redis
 

Step.5) Run docker-compose.yml file by command
   	
	- $ docker-compose up -d


Step.6) Bring down application by command
   	
	- $ docker-compose down


# How to scale services using docker-compose

	â€”scale
		$ docker-compose up -d --scale database=4

	(Note- --scale:- It is command for scaling
	       =4 :- It creates 4 database containers for one application using one server.)
